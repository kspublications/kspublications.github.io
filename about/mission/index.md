title: Our Mission
---
Correct Islāmic beliefs and actions must derive from Allāh’s Book and His Messenger’s () Sunnah, and should
be guided by the knowledge and understanding of the ṣaḥābah (). This is the clear path of guidance that
Allāh () drew for people, leading to their immediate and ultimate success and happiness.

Sadly, most Muslims have departed, to varying degrees, from this magnificent path. Thus, any serious work for
reviving Islām among the Muslims must involve two fundamental components:


1. Purification: the process of clearing this path from obstacles and obscurities, and guiding people to it.
2. Cultivation: the steady and persistent process of teaching people how to live upon this path and abide by
its dictates. These two components were central to the Prophet’s () mission, as Allāh () indicates:

«It is He who has sent among the unlettered a
Messenger from themselves: reciting to them
His āyāt, purifying them, and teaching them
the Book and Wisdom – although they were
previously in clear deviation.» 6
