﷽

Correct Islamic beliefs and actions must derive from Allah’s Book and His Messenger’s Sunnah, and should
be guided by the knowledge and understanding of his companions. This is the clear path of guidance that
Allah drew for people, leading to their immediate and ultimate success and happiness.

Sadly, most Muslims have departed, to varying degrees, from this magnificent path. Thus, any serious work for
reviving Islam among the Muslims must involve two fundamental components:

1. Purification: the process of clearing this path from obstacles and obscurities, and guiding people to it.
2. Cultivation: the steady and persistent process of teaching people how to live upon this path and abide by
its dictates. These two components were central to the Prophet’s mission, as Allah indicates:

> هُوَ الَّذِي بَعَثَ فِي الْأُمِّيِّينَ رَسُولًا مِّنْهُمْ يَتْلُو عَلَيْهِمْ آيَاتِهِ وَيُزَكِّيهِمْ وَيُعَلِّمُهُمُ الْكِتَابَ وَالْحِكْمَةَ وَإِن كَانُوا مِن قَبْلُ لَفِي ضَلَالٍ مُّبِينٍ

> «It is He who has sent among the unlettered a Messenger from themselves:
reciting to them His aayaat, purifying them, and teaching them
the Book and Wisdom – although they were previously in clear deviation.»

From this, we realize the urgency of providing the English-speaking public with serious writings that refine the
understanding of Islām and present it in a pure and simple form that incorporates two aspects:

1. Purified Islamic teachings
2. Practical guidelines for implementing them.

Indeed, this is the mission that we adopt, and this book is a humble step in that direction.
