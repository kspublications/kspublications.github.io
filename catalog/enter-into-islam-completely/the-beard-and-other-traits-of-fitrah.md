This book deals with the traits of fitrah which are among the issues that some people consider "small" or "minor". However, they are all very important for a Muslim who wishes to maintain healthy hygiene and a dignified appearance, guided in that by Allah's revelation, In addition to the beard, we deal in detail with the issues of grooming the hair, siwak, circumcision, and so on.
