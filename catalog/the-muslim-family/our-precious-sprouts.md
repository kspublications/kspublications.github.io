As a logical continuation to the previous three books, this sequel deals with the normal fruit of marriage: babies. It covers the Islamic regulations relating to a newborn. This includes welcoming the baby, naming it, shaving its hair, circumcising it, and slaughtering the sacrificial 'aqiqah. The discussion of naming the newborn covers the recommended and prohibited names, nicknames, and kunyahs. It is further enhanced with tho appendices that list Allah's authentic excellent names, as well as a large number of suggested Islamic names for both genders. The discussion of 'aqiqah includes its ruling, animals to be slaughtered, dispensing of the meat, the 'aqiaqah's feast, and the 'aqiqah's wisdom. The discussion of circumcision includes the circumcision process, its ruling for boys and girls, its benefits, and expressiveness and other violations. Other discussions include tahnik, shaving the baby's head, piercing the ears, breast-feeding, protection from the evil eye, babies' toys and clothes, birthdays, and so on. We intended - and we believe that we largely succeeded - in making this book a complete reference covering the correct Islamic acts that parents need to perform for their newborn during its first few weeks. All praise is due to Allah.
