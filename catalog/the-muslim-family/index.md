title: The Muslim Family
description: >
    This first three books in the series cover various aspects of marriage according to the authentic Sunnah. Marriage Plays a most central role in the human life, and has been largely discussed by the scholars of Islam through the ages, resulting in numerous writings and treatises. Some of those writings, mostly by contemporary scholars, have been translated to English. However, we find them restricted in scope, addressing Muslims who live in predominantly Islamic countries, or overlooking important real issues that have developed under the modern civilization. This leaves quite a large gap that needs to be filled for the benefit of the Muslims in English-speaking countries, and this is what we attempt to fulfill over the span of three books. The final book in the series is a logical continuation to this topic, which deals with the normal fruit of marriage babies.
