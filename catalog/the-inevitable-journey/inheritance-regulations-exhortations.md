We inevitably go through the journey starting in this life, and extending into the grave, before our final abode in the hereafter. In the process, we pass through stages of sickness, death, and the intermediate life in the grave (al-Barzakh). Writing a will is a religious obligation on every capable Muslim. It protects against many problems and conflicts that could arise after a persons death. This obligation is more emphasized in the West; Failing to write a well founded will may result in the distribution of ones estate in discord with the Islamic law, and may lead to losses for some of the rightful inheritors.
