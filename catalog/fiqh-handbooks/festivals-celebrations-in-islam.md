Festivals and celebrations are occasions of joy and happiness.
They have their distinctive spirit in all societies and cultures,
and are eagerly awaited and heartily welcomed by everyone.

The feeling of excitement associated with these occasions, however,
causes people to introduce uncommon, strange or even bizarre practices during them.

Islam regulates the occasions to be celebrated and the methods of celebrating them.
It maintains their atmosphere of happiness, while redirecting it to benefit the
individuals and the Muslim communities.

This book discusses the two annual Islaamic festivals:
Eid ul-Fitr and Eid ul-Adhaa as well as the weekly Jumu'ah.
It presents the Islaamic guidelines for celebration according to
the Quraan and Sunnah, and warns against innovated occasions and un-Islaamic festivals.

In addition to topics that are standard to 'Id celebration, such as the 'Id prayer and khutbah,
and 'Id pastimes, this book discusses zakat-ul-fitr, the sacrifice,
the blessed days of the month of Thul-Hijjah, and numerous other 'Id-related issues.

The broad and thorough discussions in this book make it an important manual and
complete reference on festivals and celebrations in Islam.
Indeed, from Allah (swt) we seek help and acceptance.
