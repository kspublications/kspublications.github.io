With Allah's help, and in line with our goal of promoting authentic Islamic knowledge, we present this book. It deals with a largely misunderstood, though much needed subject, both in Ramadan and around the year: that of voluntary night prayers, or qiyam. This book has two main objectives: Providing a complete manual on the subject of qiyam and related issues in accordance with the Qur'an, the Sunnah, and the guidance of the Salaf, and, in the process, presenting to the English reader two important works by the great scholar Muhammad Nasir ud-Deen al-Albani: Salat ut-Tarawih and Qiyam Ramadan. This book is not for Ramadan only, rather, it is for every night. It is the type of reference that you will want to keep by your pillow at night, and grab as soon as you get up in the wee hours to pray. It is a gift that is sure to please and benefit - inshaa'llaah.
