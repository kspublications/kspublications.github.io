This series of books relates stories of outstanding moral and educational value. The stories are exclusively taken from texts of the Qur’an and the authentic Sunnah. The narrations are enhanced by extensive remarks and commentaries, and are supplemented with important conclusions and lessons. This series provides excellent reading material for Muslims at large and Muslim youth in particular. Whereas the language and discussion level target individuals who have completed elementary school, teachers may also find this series useful for reading to elementary school students. This particular book presents amazing aspects and details of the story of the noble prophet Ibrahim. Ibrahim’s sublime character and exemplary righteousness made him indeed a perpetual guide for multitudes of people, and a man who equaled a nation, rather: nations.
