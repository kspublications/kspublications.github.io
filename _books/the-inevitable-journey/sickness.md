This book is the first in the series. It deals with sickness, which continues to afflict human beings from birth until death. Sickness strikes as light as a simple cold or allergy, and as hard as a plague or cancer. It keeps the human being in check, reminding him of his weakness and giving him a chance to turn to the One who possesses the ability to afflict and cure. This book deals with sickness, its regulations, and lessons associated with it. It presents the Islamic stance on a number of modern medical issues, and also discusses important regulations relating to those with disabilities.
