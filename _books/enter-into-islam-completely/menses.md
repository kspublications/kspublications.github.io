A normal woman spends about one quarter of her life in a state of menses or post-natal bleeding. During those times, a woman is physically and emotionally stressed. She needs special guidelines to help her conduct her religious and daily life properly and satisfactorily. Islam, being the final and most complete religion, thoroughly covers and wisely directs all aspects of the human life. Therefore, it is no wonder that it deals with menses issues in a clear and sympathetic manner. When the Islaamic regulations of menses are well understood and correctly implemented, they make it easy for a woman to conduct her close-to-illness menstrual cycle in a smooth and balanced manner. Because of this, we find it necessary to reestablish the correct Islaamic teachings regarding various menses issues. Thus, we offer to our readers the present book, in hopes that it will help shed light on and guide many Muslim women to a fulfilling and practical spiritual life during menses.
