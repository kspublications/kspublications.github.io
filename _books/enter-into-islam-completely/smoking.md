This book deals with the epidemic of smoking, which has entered into the houses of the Muslims in a most devastating manner. What Makes this problem even worse is than many of the Muslims do not see or admit to the prohibition of smoking and its great danger. Rather, When they are advised about it, they quickly echo a thing they heard from so-called scholars: "But it is not Prohibited - it is only disliked!" This necessitates providing some advice to those people who seek the truth but have only heard the wrong views of the shallow minded. It is important to present a clear picture of smoking , and a detailed reasoning for its prohibition.
