This book deals with smoking, which has entered into the houses of Muslims in a most devastating manner. What makes this problem worse is that many Muslims do not admit to the prohibition of smoking and its danger. When they are advised about it, they quickly echo a common misunderstanding: "But it is not Prohibited - it is only disliked!"  This book presents a clear picture of smoking , and a detailed reasoning from the Qur'an and Sunnah for its prohibition.
